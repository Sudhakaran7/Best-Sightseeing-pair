Given an array A of positive integers, A[i] represents the value of the i-th sightseeing spot, and two sightseeing spots i and j have distance j - i between them.
The score of a pair (i < j) of sightseeing spots is (A[i] + A[j] + i - j) : the sum of the values of the sightseeing spots, minus the distance between them.
Return the maximum score of a pair of sightseeing spots.

Input Description:
First line contains N the size of array A.(1<N<100)
Second line contains, N elements of integers in a array.

Output Description:
Print the maximum score of a pair of sightseeing spots.

Sample Input:
5
8 1 5 2 6

Sample Output:

Explanation:
From the given array, i = 0, j = 2, A[i] + A[j] + i - j = 8 + 5 + 0 - 2 = 11,
So the output is 11.
